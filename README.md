1.Make a simple useful JAVA console application that uses a tree structure.

2. Document your application.
 
Introduce what is it?
A console application is a computer program that works with text and runs from a command line. It's a simple and quick tool that can be used on any system, especially for tasks where you don't need a visual display.

This Java application is a simple name management system implemented using a binary search tree data structure.

 
Describe what it can do?
The application allows users to insert, search for, and delete names from a list.  It provides a console-based interface for easy interaction.
 
Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?
The code for a console application that creates a Binary Search Tree is a great resource for everyone. It helps people learn about data structures and the basics of Java programming. This code is very useful for organizing and finding data efficiently, as well as for managing changing data. It also encourages teamwork and sharing, which can improve software development since others can use and build on it. Plus, its easy-to-use design makes it suitable for many different users. Overall, this code can positively affect developers, students, and anyone interested in computer science.
